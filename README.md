# Message Center
The Message Center app is a solution that reads message center from a SharePoint list and presents it to non-admin users with an intuitive interface. This data is typically retrieved from the Graph API via Power Automate and saved to a list that all users have read access to. This data is usually refreshed on a regular schedule (15 minutes).
